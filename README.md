I recently bought a Surface Go 3 for web browsing in tablet mode. I found the user experience lacking compared to Android and desktop. This is a simple project adds some useful touch gestures mostly for chromium based browsers.

1. 1 Finger Swipe Down: Close tab (Ctrl + W)
1. 2 Finger Swipe Left: Previous Tab (Ctrl + Shift + Tab)
1. 2 Finger Swipe Right: Next Tab (Ctrl + Tab)
1. 2 Finger Swipe Up: Restore tab (Ctrl + Shift + T)
1. 2 Finger Swipe Down: Close App (Alt + F4)
